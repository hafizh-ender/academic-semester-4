title = "On kernel functions for bi-fidelity Gaussian process regressions",
abstract = "This paper investigates the impact of kernel functions on the accuracy of bi-fidelity Gaussian process regressions (GPR) for engineering applications. The potential of composite kernel learning (CKL) and model selection is also studied, aiming to ease the process of manual kernel selection. Using the autoregressive Gaussian process as the base model, this paper studies four kernel functions and their combinations: Gaussian, Matern-3/2, Matern-5/2, and Cubic. Experiments on four engineering test problems show that the best kernel is problem dependent and sometimes might be counter-intuitive, even when a large amount of low-fidelity data already aids the model. In this regard, using CKL or automatic kernel selection via cross validation and maximum likelihood can reduce the tendency to select a poor-performing kernel. In addition, the CKL technique can create a slightly more accurate model than the best-performing individual kernel. The main drawback of CKL is its significantly expensive computational cost. The results also show that, given a sufficient amount of samples, tuning the regression term is important to improve the accuracy and robustness of bi-fidelity GPR, while decreasing the importance of the proper kernel selection.",

abstract = {This paper discusses the experimental optimization of an artificial caudal fin to maximize thrust production. A combination of direct experimental measurement and Gaussian Process modeling was applied to optimize the time-averaged net thrust force produced by the fin panel. Specifically, this paper investigates the effect of the fin panel’s stiffness and flapping frequency on the thrust force. The Gaussian Process regression is primarily used to model the relationship between the flapping frequency and thrust force, with variations in the fin panel’s stiffness. Results show that the optimum flapping frequency that yields maximum force tends to decrease as the stiffness decreases. Furthermore, increasing the lateral amplitude displacement of the fin base leads to a higher time-averaged net thrust force. Further investigation shows that the phase difference between the trailing and leading edge of the oscillating fin should be about 90°to yield optimum time-averaged net thrust force.}
